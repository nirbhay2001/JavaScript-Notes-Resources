 Ajax --> Ajax, which initially stood for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, is a programming practice of building complex, dynamic webpages using a technology known as XMLHttpRequest.
                                                    Ajax allows you
 to update parts of the DOM of an HTML page instead without the need for a full page refresh. Ajax also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code continues to run while the targeted part of your web page is trying to reload(compared to synchronously, whic blocks your code from running that part of your page is done reloading).
